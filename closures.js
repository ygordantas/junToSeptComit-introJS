// The word lexical refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared
// within the source code to determine where that variable is available.
//
// JavaScript uses lexical scoping,
// so functions are executed using the variable scope that was in place when the function was defined, not when itâ€™s called.

/*
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
This environment consists of any variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.

// it is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if closures are not needed for a particular task,
